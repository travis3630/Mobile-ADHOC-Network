### Final Courswork
### Aims:

5. MANET system
Design a simulator based on a MANET standard. Investigate the transmission power and coverage area of the
MANET system. Investigate the channel propagation model, based on the channel magnitude versus frequency
and time 3D plot. Study the efficiency of the MANET system in terms of the battery life, transmission rate,
transmission reliability, transmission delay, bandwidth and hardware complexity.
